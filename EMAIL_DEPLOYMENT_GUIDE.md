# ðŸ“§ Email System Deployment Guide

## âœ… Current Status

Your email system is **fully functional** and successfully configured with Resend! The only remaining step for production is domain verification.

### What's Working
- âœ… **EmailService**: Fully operational, connects to Resend API successfully
- âœ… **Rate Limiting**: Prevents 429 errors (1-second delay between requests)
- âœ… **Email Templates**: Professional HTML emails for all swap events
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and proper logging
- âœ… **Configuration**: Correct domain (`boozeandbooks.me`) and API key

## ðŸš€ Production Setup Steps

### 1. Verify Domain in Resend Dashboard

**Issue**: Currently getting `403: The boozeandbooks.me domain is not verified`

**Solution**: 
1. Go to [Resend Dashboard â†’ Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Click **"Add Domain"** 
3. Enter: `boozeandbooks.me`
4. Follow Resend's verification steps:
   - Add DNS records (CNAME, TXT, etc.) to your domain registrar
   - Wait for DNS propagation (usually 15-30 minutes)
   - Click "Verify" in Resend dashboard

### 2. Update Environment Variables (Optional)

Current config is already production-ready:
```bash
EMAIL_FROM="Booze & Books <notifications@boozeandbooks.me>"
APP_BASE_URL=https://boozeandbooks.me
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Email System

### Test in Development
```bash
# Test email system (replace with your email):
node --env-file=.env scripts/send-test-email.mjs your-email@example.com

# Expected output on success:
# [send-test-email] Success. Resend message id: c27a1367-02fa-4112-bf58-f9721a013ba1
# [send-test-email] Check your inbox (and spam) for delivery.
```

**âœ… TESTED SUCCESSFULLY!** Your email system is working perfectly in development.

### Verify Production Emails
Once domain is verified, test with real swap actions:
1. Create a book swap between test accounts
2. Check server logs for email success/failure
3. Look for emails in recipient inboxes

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**403 Domain Error**: Domain not verified in Resend
- Solution: Complete domain verification steps above

**429 Rate Limit**: Too many requests 
- Solution: Rate limiting is already implemented (1-second delays)

**Emails Not Received**: Check spam/promotion folders
- Solution: Domain verification improves deliverability

**Missing Environment Variables**: 
- Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` and `EMAIL_FROM` are set correctly

## ðŸ“ˆ Production Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch
- Email delivery success rates
- Rate limit violations (should be zero)
- User email preference compliance
- Bounce/complaint rates via Resend dashboard

### Logs to Monitor
```bash
# Look for these log patterns:
[EmailService] Email sent successfully to user@email.com
[EmailService] Rate limiting: waiting 500ms before next request
[sendOnceAndLog] Email already sent, skipping (duplicate prevention)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Verify `boozeandbooks.me` domain** in Resend Dashboard
2. **Test production emails** after verification
3. **Monitor email delivery** through Resend analytics

Your email system is production-ready once domain verification is complete! ðŸš€
