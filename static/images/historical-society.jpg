# Placeholder for historical society image

This file represents where a historical society image would be placed for the themed homepage.
In a real implementation, this would be an actual image file (JPG, PNG, etc.) showing:
- Historical literary societies
- Vintage book collections
- Classical library scenes
- Literary salon gatherings

The image should enhance the historical theme of the application while maintaining
visual appeal and loading performance.
